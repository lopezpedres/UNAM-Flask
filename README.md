## Getting Started
Create and activate virtualenv (recomended) and install Jupyter Labs

```bash 
pip install jupyterlab 
```
Type `jupyter-lab` to open the notebooks in your browser

Make sure that the Docker CLI is installed and you have a working Docker environment.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

All services are defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
